## How to use the selected ParcelShop data

You have to include the **mainDataExtractor(event)** function in the source of your webpage. This function returns the actually selected parcelShop data in an object.

The mainDataExtractor function works with the click event as an argument. The function triggers when the click event happens on the selected marker icon, or one of the sideBar list elements. If the click happens not on the marker icon, the active parcelshop will be DESELECTED.

The MainMap.activeIconID stores the actually selected ParcelshopID too.

## Sample source code:

You can easily download the sample html code through this link: https://myfirstwebapp-siwvh.run-eu-central1.goorm.io/apirequests/pclshopsamplehtmlcode

## Live demo: https://myfirstwebapp-siwvh.run-eu-central1.goorm.io/leafletpclshopfinder

## Code:

The main code has been written in **_ES2021_**. However the targeted browsers ends with **_Internet explorer 11_**.

The default Javascript code that is linked into the sample html file is a **_transpiled code_** from the original.

That means the plugin with standard settings runs easily on Internet explorer 11 too.

You can get the modern version of the code from this link: https://myfirstwebapp-siwvh.run-eu-central1.goorm.io/apirequests/glsparcelshopfindermodern
